# IP-Inventory
 script scans your local network to detect active devices, logs their IP addresses, and attempts to resolve their hostnames. Instead of manually specifying an IP range, the script automatically calculates the network range based on the IP address of your local device and performs a scan to find other devices connected to the same network.
